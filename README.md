### Hi there 👋


# **My name is Alexander Constantinou and this is my read me page**

I am currently learning how to become a software developer and have had lessons on the following ✔️
-  Types of data
-  Manipulating data
-  for and while loops
-  Using the terminal
-  Using Github and local repositories

A husky is one of my favourite types of *dogs*
